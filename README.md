# GhostCloak - Linux
GhostCloak is a privacy toolset that randomizes your MAC address, connects to a random Windscribe VPN server, and enforces VPN-only traffic with firewall rules. Includes an anti-script to revert changes and desktop launchers for quick use.
EDIT GhostCloak.desktop and AntiGhost.desktop FILES AND ADD THE PATH TO FILES.
